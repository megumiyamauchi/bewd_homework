Write a program which will ask for a starting year 
and an ending year, 
and then puts all of the leap years between them 
(and including them, if they are also leap years).

Leap years are years divisible by four 
(like 1984 and 2004). 
However, years divisible by 100 are not leap years 
(such as 1800 and 1900) unless they are divisible 
by 400 (like 1600 and 2000, which were in fact leap years).

puts "please enter a starting year"
start_year = gets.chomp

puts "You entered" start_year

puts "please enter an ending year"
end_year = gets.chomp

puts "You entered" end_year

if
	start_year = 4 and end_year = 4
	and 

end
